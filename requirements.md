## Problem Statement

Listens to a simulated sensor data stream (you may use mock data).
Validates the incoming data based on simple predefined rules (e.g., temperature range, proper format, etc.).
Sends alerts (can be console logs for this exercise) when the data does not conform to the set rules.
Logs the incoming data and its validation status.

### Requirements:

- Use Express.js for the HTTP server.
- Implement at least one endpoint that can be hit to retrieve the validation status of the last 10 data points.
- Use any local database (e.g., PostgreSQL/MongoDB) to store the data.
- Consider edge cases (e.g., missing data, corrupt data).
- Include basic error handling.

### Expected Deliverables:

- Source code of the implemented microservice.
- A brief README on how to set up, run, and test the service.

## Objective

The objective of this task is to assess your hands-on coding skills, understanding of microservices, error handling, and basic database operations in a Node.js environment.
